SNS Desalinated (A Modding Framework)

This is a modding framework for Salt & Sanctuary that adds new features for specializing gameplay. Includes new global settings 
and value based loot specials such as: attack speed%, potion healing values, dynamic spell costs in the GUI, weapon and spell 
scaling controls, alternative formulas for game mechanics, and much more!

This repository only features documentation, as displaying the code for the mod would also display code for the original game.
The mod itself can found here => https://www.nexusmods.com/saltandsanctuary/mods/9
